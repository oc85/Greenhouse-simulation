The Smart Greenhouse Project aimed to create a user-friendly and efficient system for managing and simulating greenhouse conditions. The project incorporated various features such as dynamic parameter adjustments, actuator controls, and a visual simulation of plant growth. Here are the key points of the project's conclusion:

•The system allows users to adjust critical parameters such as temperature, light intensity, moisture, and humidity

•The project includes actuator controls for heating, cooling, humidifying, dehumidifying, irrigation, and lighting

•These controls automatically adjust based on the current conditions and target parameters, ensuring optimal growth conditions for the selected crop

•The project features a visual simulation of plant growth, providing users with a clear representation of how their adjustments impact plant development over time

•The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use

•The simulation includes a series of images that depict the growth stages of the selected crop, giving users a realistic view of the growth process

•Users can select different crops, each with its own set of optimal growth parameters
